[L4.P1] Another interesting test you should try is calling add_number twice in a row with the same argument - what happens? 
      It just doubles the size of the vector and puts 10 more values in. It doesn't show two vectors, just one that is twice as big.
      
      
[L4.P4]Did it work? What is a very simple test that you can run? 
    Yes it worked. You can try it unsorted then try it sorted. Over and over the values are coming out sorted. It works!
